# OFUCU - Opinionated Flash to Unity Conversion Utility
OFUCU is a Unity package to import and convert the contents of a Flash SWF File to Unity UI.

OFUCU is very opinionated in how it converts the files. It was designed with a specific use case in mind. However, it should be adaptable enough to many other use cases if needed.

TODO: comming soon, usage, examples, and documentation
